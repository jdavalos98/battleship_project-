Project Reflection:

Without an interaction pattern and gameplay replacing testing, it was really hard to figure out where to begin. Honestly, Karl had to ask Kaelin for some advice to even get his code moving whatsoever. However, Joel did some excellent research and came to a lot of the same conclusions on his own. Unfortunately we were unable to make through the entirety of iteration 3, even though the logic was really starting to make a lot of sense. With some time I feel we would have gotten into a groove of writing each of the last parts for example regestering hits on both user and computer ships and use a tip from Khoa to set our user and cpu shots as the same thing to allow us to test hits, misses, and sinks. With that tip and maybe one more hour session with Brady or a cohort mate and we would be well on our way. 

If we had one more day of work for this project we would probably finish iteration 3. The logic was slowly coming to us and I feel that with the extra day we would have a functioning game that we could enjoy playing.

For a majority of our time during this project the main paring technique we used was the driver navigator technique. We seemed to work very well using it and when we would it blockers it was usually when we decided to pull someone in to help or decide it ws time to do some individual work. 

Throughout the project we would share feedback in real time as one of us was driving. When we were doing individual work most of our feedback was given though slack and we tried to name our commits to relay info to each other as well.
